## üíª Project

This project was develped based on a Figma design provied by the school. The main practice was fetching data using GitHub API with Axios and improve app performance with useCallback, useMemo and memo. Also, I used Context API to access functions and variables across components and implemented use-context-selector packacge for better performance. I took some liberties and challenge myself to implement a loading state on components, a pagination at home page and setup React Markdown to convert markdown to HTML.

**It includes:** A home page containing user card and posts list with pagination and filter by query string; A post page with post contents; A fallback page for general errors such as 404.
